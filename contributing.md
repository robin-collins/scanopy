## Getting Started

### Quick Start for Service Definitions

**The easiest way to contribute is by adding service definitions!** Service definitions help Scanopy identify and categorize network services during discovery. This is a great first contribution that doesn't require deep knowledge of the codebase. Given the wide variety of services that folks run across their networks, this is inherently best handled as a community-driven effort.

If you're interested in adding a service definition, jump to the [Adding Service Definitions](#adding-service-definitions) section.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Service Definitions (Recommended for First-Time Contributors)

Service definitions are small, focused additions that help Scanopy discover and identify specific services on your network. Examples include:

- Home automation platforms (Home Assistant, OpenHAB)
- Media servers (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby)
- Infrastructure services (Pi-hole, AdGuard, Traefik)
- Development tools (Portainer, Grafana, Jenkins)

### 2. Bug Reports

Found a bug? [Please open an issue!](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

### 3. Documentation

Help improve our documentation:

- Fix typos or clarify existing docs
- Add examples or tutorials for specific setups
- Improve installation instructions
- Document troubleshooting steps

### 4. Code Contributions

For larger features or bug fixes:

- Discuss your idea in an issue first
- Follow the development workflow below
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 5. Integrations (Advanced)

A new way for Scanopy to collect data — a device API, a controller, a management protocol. Much
larger than a service definition: a credential type, a daemon-side collector, and a set of
declarations the compiler will demand from you. Discuss it in an issue first, then see
[Adding an Integration](#adding-an-integration).

### 6. Translations

Help make Scanopy accessible to users worldwide by contributing translations:

- **Weblate**: [hosted.weblate.org/engage/scanopy](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/scanopy/)

This is a great way to contribute without needing to set up a development environment!

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

**For Daemon Development:**

- Linux / WSL2: Docker with host networking support, OR binary installation
- macOS: Binary installation only (Docker Desktop does not support host networking)
- Windows: Native development supported

**For Server Development:**

- Rust 1.90 or later
- Node.js 20 or later
- PostgreSQL 17
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized development)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy.git
   cd scanopy
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**

    On Ubuntu/Debian:
   1. Install NVM and Node.js 22

        ```bash
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
        nvm install 22
        nvm use 22
        ```

   2. Install postgresql-17

        ```bash
        sudo apt install curl ca-certificates gnupg2 wget vim -y
        sudo install -d /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg
        sudo curl -o /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.asc --fail https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc
        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.asc] https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt -y install postgresql-17
        ```

   3. Install project dependencies

        ```bash
        make install-dev-linux
        ```

    On macOS:
   1. Install Homebrew if not already installed

        ```bash
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
        ```

   2. Install Rust, Node.js 20, and PostgreSQL 17

        ```bash
        brew install rust node@20 postgresql@17
        ```

   3. Install project dependencies

        ```bash
        make install-dev-mac
        ```

        This installs:
        - Rust toolchain with rustfmt and clippy
        - Node.js dependencies

    On Windows:

   1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (download and run `rustup-init.exe`)
   2. Install [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS installer) or via [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
   3. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for the PostgreSQL dev database)
   4. Install `make` via one of:
      - [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/): `choco install make`
      - [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/): `scoop install make`
      - Or use Git Bash (included with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win))
   5. Clone and install:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy.git
        cd scanopy
        make install-dev-windows
        ```

3. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   make setup-db
   ```

   This starts a PostgreSQL container on port 5432.

### Development Environments

You have two options for development:

#### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended)

Run components individually with hot reload:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start the server
make dev-server

# Terminal 2 - Start the UI
make dev-ui

# Terminal 3 - Start the daemon (if needed)
make dev-daemon
```

**Advantages:**

- Faster iteration with hot reload
- Easier debugging
- More control over individual components

#### Option 2: Containerized Development

Run everything in Docker containers:

```bash
# Start all services
make dev-container

# Rebuild containers
make dev-container-rebuild

# Clean rebuild (no cache)
make dev-container-rebuild-clean

# Stop all services
make dev-down
```

**Use this when:**

- Testing the full stack together
- You want a production-like environment
- You're having dependency issues locally

### Accessing the Application

Once running:

- **UI**: <http://localhost:5173> (with hot reload)
- **Server API**: <http://localhost:60072>
- **Daemon API**: <http://localhost:60073>

### Known Limitations

**Multi-tab SSE hang (local dev only):** Opening the same page in multiple browser tabs may cause the second tab to hang. This is caused by the browser's HTTP/1.1 connection limit (~6 per domain). Each page opens persistent SSE connections for real-time updates, which consume connection slots across all tabs. This does not affect production deployments (HTTP/2 via reverse proxy multiplexes all streams over one connection). Workaround: use separate browser profiles, or use a local reverse proxy with HTTP/2 support.

## Development Workflow

### Before You Start

1. Create a new branch for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. If working on the server/daemon, ensure fresh start:

   ```bash
   make clean-daemon  # Clear daemon config
   make clean-db      # Stop and remove database
   make setup-db      # Create fresh database
   ```

### During Development

1. **Write your code**
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep changes focused and atomic

2. **Test your changes**

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

   Note - this will tear down all containers, including the PostgreSql container; you'll need to recreate that after running.

   You can dump the DB if you want to hold on to the data and reload the container from the dump.

   ```bash
   make dump-db
   ```

3. **Format your code**

   ```bash
   make format
   ```

4. **Lint your code**

   ```bash
   make lint
   ```

### Before Submitting

**Always run these commands before creating a PR:**

```bash
make format  # Format all code
make lint    # Check for issues
make test    # Run all tests
```

All three commands must pass without errors before submitting your PR.

### Database Migrations

Migrations live in `backend/migrations/` and must be backward-compatible — during deploys, old and new application code run side by side and a breaking migration crashes the old container. The full rules (expand-and-contract patterns, `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `lock_timeout`, batched backfills) live in the Scanopy infrastructure repo's `migration-guidelines.md`. Run `make lint-migrations` before pushing. CI enforces this in two layers: `squawk` lints every PR, and the release workflow applies each migration to a Neon branch off production before publishing Docker images.

## Adding Service Definitions

Service definitions are the best place to start contributing! They help Scanopy identify and categorize services during network discovery.

### Project Structure

Service definitions are located in:

```
backend/src/server/services/definitions/
├── mod.rs                 # Module registry
├── home_assistant.rs      # Example service definition
├── plex.rs                # Example service definition
└── your_service.rs        # Your new service definition
```

### Step 1: Create Your Service File

Create a new file in `backend/src/server/services/definitions/` named after your service (e.g., `grafana.rs`):

```rust
use crate::server::hosts::types::ports::PortBase;
use crate::server::services::definitions::{create_service, ServiceDefinitionFactory};
use crate::server::services::types::categories::ServiceCategory;
use crate::server::services::types::definitions::ServiceDefinition;
use crate::server::services::types::patterns::Pattern;

#[derive(Default, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
pub struct Grafana;

impl ServiceDefinition for Grafana {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str { 
        "Grafana" 
    }
    
    fn description(&self) -> &'static str { 
        "Metrics dashboard and visualization platform" 
    }
    
    fn category(&self) -> ServiceCategory { 
        ServiceCategory::Monitoring 
    }
    
    fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
        Pattern::Endpoint(
            PortBase::Http,
            "/api/health",
            "grafana"
        )
    }
    
    fn logo_url(&self) -> &'static str { 
        "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/svg/service-logo.svg"
    }
}

// This macro registers your service for automatic discovery
inventory::submit!(ServiceDefinitionFactory::new(create_service::<Grafana>));
```

### Step 2: Register the Module

Add your module to `backend/src/server/services/definitions/mod.rs`:

```rust
pub mod grafana;  // Add this line
```

That's it! Your service will now be automatically discovered during network scans.

### Understanding Pattern Types

Patterns define how Scanopy identifies your service. 

Here are the available pattern types:

#### Endpoint Patterns

This is the preferred match type, as the existence of the name of the service in a response is a strong signal that it is in fact the service in question.

That said, some services will contain the unique name of a service in circumstances like:
1. Dashboards will contain multiple service names depending on the service being displayed
2. Service names that are short or parts of common words can be contained in other words (ie "Plex" is part of the word "Complex", so if a service has the word "Complex" on the endpoint being checked it will cause a false positive)

So, it's best to include another pattern alongside a Pattern::Endpoint just to be sure, or use a very specific string match (ie a phrase rather than a word).

**Pattern::Endpoint**
Check if an endpoint returns expected content:

```rust
fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::Endpoint(
        PortBase::Http,           // Port to check
        "/api/service",            // Path
        "service_name"                 // Expected text in response
    )
}
```

#### Simple Port Patterns

This pattern is acceptable if there are no usable endpoints (ie they require authentication, SSL, or otherwise don't provide service-identifying information), but try to create a pattern with multiple unique ports or combine ports with other information to make the match more precise.

**Pattern::Port**
Match a specific port:

```rust
fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::Port(PortBase::Http)  // Port 80
}
```

Common PortBase values:

- `PortBase::Http` (80)
- `PortBase::Https` (443)
- `PortBase::HttpAlt` (8080)
- `PortBase::Ssh` (22)
- `PortBase::DnsUdp` (53)
- For custom ports: `PortBase::new_tcp(8000)` or `PortBase::new_udp(1900)`

**Note** UDP pattern matching is barely supported outside of DNS and a few others. Please don't rely heavily on UDP ports.

#### Logical Patterns

**Pattern::AnyOf**
Match if ANY pattern succeeds:

```rust
fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::AnyOf(vec![
        Pattern::Port(PortBase::new_tcp(32400)),
        Pattern::Endpoint(PortBase::Http, "/web", "Plex", None)
    ])
}
```

**Pattern::AllOf**
Match ONLY if ALL patterns succeed:

```rust
fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::AllOf(vec![
        Pattern::Port(PortBase::Http),
        Pattern::Port(PortBase::new_tcp(8443))
    ])
}
```

**Pattern::Not**
Inverse of a pattern:

```rust
fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::Not(&Pattern::IsGateway)
}
```

#### Special Patterns

**Pattern::IsGateway**
Matches if the host is in the routing table as a gateway:

```rust
fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::IsGateway
}
```

**Pattern::MacVendor**
Match based on MAC address vendor:

```rust
use crate::server::services::types::patterns::Vendor;

fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::MacVendor(Vendor::EERO)
}
```

To add new Vendor:: values:

1. Go to `backend/src/server/services/types/patterns.rs` and ctrl+f "pub struct Vendor;"
2. Use `https://gist.github.com/aallan/b4bb86db86079509e6159810ae9bd3e4` to identify the string used by a vendor for their MAC address patterns.
3. Add your new Vendor value: 

```rust 
pub const NEWVENDOR: &'static str = "Acme, Inc"
```;

**Pattern::SubnetIsType**
Match based on subnet type:
```rust
use crate::server::subnets::types::base::SubnetType;

fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::SubnetIsType(SubnetType::Guest)
}
```

For a list of subnet types and information on how they are derived, check out `backend/src/server/subnets/types/base.rs`. 
`pub enum SubnetType` has the list, and the method `from_interface_name` has specifics on how they are matched.

**Pattern::None**
For services that aren't auto-discovered (manual only):

```rust
fn discovery_pattern(&self) -> Pattern<'_> {
    Pattern::None
}
```

### Service Categories

Choose the most appropriate category. If the service you want to add doesn't fit the category, you can add one at `backend/src/server/services/types/categories.rs`.

#### Infrastructure

- `ServiceCategory::NetworkCore` - Switches, core infrastructure
- `ServiceCategory::NetworkAccess` - Routers, access points
- `ServiceCategory::NetworkSecurity` - Firewalls, security appliances
- `ServiceCategory::DNS` - DNS servers
- `ServiceCategory::VPN` - VPN servers
- `ServiceCategory::ReverseProxy` - Nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, etc

#### Server Services

### Optional Properties

#### Generic Services
Mark services not tied to a specific brand.

```rust
fn is_generic(&self) -> bool { 
    true 
}
```

#### Service Icons

Scanopy supports icons from three sources.

**Dashboard Icons** (Recommended - has the most service icons):

`https://dashboardicons.com/icons/home-assistant`

Search for the service and press the link button to get a URL like

`"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/svg/home-assistant.svg"`


**Simple Icons**:

`simpleicons.org/icons/`

Search for the service and right click an image to open in a new tab and get the URL like:

`https://simpleicons.org/icons/homeassistant.svg`

**Vector Logo Zone**:

`vectorlogo.zone/logos/`

Search for the service then press the clipboard button to get a URL like:

`https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/akamai/akamai-icon.svg`

**White Background** (for dark logos):

```rust
fn logo_needs_white_background(&self) -> bool {
    true
}
```

Browse available icons:

- Dashboard Icons: <https://dashboardicons.com/>
- Simple Icons: <https://simpleicons.org/icons/>

```

## Adding an Integration

An integration is one way for Scanopy to collect data: SNMP, a Docker socket, a UniFi controller.
Each is a single implementation of `DiscoveryIntegration`
(`backend/src/daemon/discovery/integration/mod.rs`) bound to one credential type, registered in
`IntegrationRegistry::get`, and dispatched generically — `probe()` decides whether the service
answers this credential, `execute()` collects and enriches. Nothing about your integration belongs
in the orchestrator.

This is a large contribution. Open an issue first.

### 0. First check it needs a credential at all

Two questions, before anything else.

**Is there credential material?** A secret, an account, an endpoint. If the whole payload would be
one optional local path, it is not a credential — machine-local settings belong in the daemon's own
configuration, alongside flags like `--interfaces`.

**Whose data is it?** An integration authenticates to a service that knows about *other* entities:
Docker's containers, a controller's switches. Anything that describes the daemon's **own host** is
self-description, and it belongs in the unconditional daemon-host phase
(`run_daemon_host_interfaces_phase` in `backend/src/daemon/discovery/service/self_report.rs`)
instead. That path needs no credential, no dispatch and no platform gate — probe for the capability
and do nothing when it is absent, which also keeps working on whichever operating systems happen to
support it.

Getting this wrong is expensive in a direction that is hard to reverse: a credential type that
targets the daemon host is always treated as user-assigned, so on a machine where the underlying
software is not installed it reports a failure on **every scan**, and there is no suppression path.

### 1. A credential type is about ten files

The compiler finds most of them, because every match is exhaustive with no wildcard:

- `server/credentials/impl/types/mod.rs` — the variant, plus arms in `merge_redacted_secrets`,
  `credential_category`, `targets`, `single_endpoint_per_host`, `get_inline_value`,
  `associated_service` and `to_query_payload`.
- `server/credentials/impl/types/metadata.rs` — nine arms: `to_credential_type`,
  `upstream_support`, `icon`, `display_name`, `integration_discovers`, `transport_note`,
  `transport_label`, `minimum_daemon_version` and `stability`.
- `server/credentials/impl/types/fields.rs` — the form field definitions.
- `server/credentials/impl/mapping.rs` — the wire payload variant and the discriminant conversion.
- `server/services/definitions/<name>.rs` and `definitions/mod.rs`, plus a new `ClientProbe`
  variant in `server/services/impl/patterns.rs`.
- `daemon/discovery/integration/<name>/`, plus the `IntegrationRegistry::get` arm.

Then run `make generate-fixtures`, which regenerates `ui/src/lib/data/credential-types.json`,
`integrations.json`, and the `meta_credential_types_*` keys in `messages/en.json`.

**No UI code is required.** `CredentialForm.svelte` builds the form from that metadata.

Two things that look like broken tooling and are not:

- Adding a variant to `CredentialType` fails the DB-enum backward-compatibility test
  (`test_current_writes_subset_of_previous_release`). A brand-new variant is absent from the
  recorded baseline, so *every* variant reads as added. It is resolved by regenerating the baseline
  at release time, not by changing your code.
- A new *enum-valued* metadata field generates no `messages/en.json` keys. The generator emits
  names, descriptions and per-field labels only; enum values like `stability` get hand-written
  message keys.

### 2. `associated_service()` is a gate, not a label

If the service definition your credential names is not *matched on the host*, `execute()` never
runs, and the operator is told the service was not identified. Your `ServiceDefinition` needs a
`Pattern::ClientResponse(ClientProbe::Yours)` arm, and your `probe()` has to produce that match.

### 3. `HostData` is shared, and interfaces merge

Several integrations can collect one host in a single scan against one `HostData`. Scalar host
fields are first-write-wins. Interfaces go through `contribute_interfaces`, which merges
contributions by interface identity: you declare `interface_view_scope()` on the trait — there is no
default, so you cannot compile without choosing — and that decides which row wins where two
collectors describe the same interface. You never need to check whether someone else already
collected interfaces.

### 4. Declare completeness honestly

This is where the real bugs are. Two separate facts, and they travel together in one call
deliberately — splitting them was a live data-loss bug.

- **`interfaces_complete`** — is this an authoritative, complete list? `false` if your walk was cut
  short, and `false` if your protocol only ever sees part of the device. A `true` here authorises
  the server to **delete** interfaces it holds and you did not report, and with them the topology
  links resolved onto those rows.
- **`InterfaceDataComplete { lldp, cdp, fdb, vlan_membership }`** — which groups you read *in full*.
  Every field defaults to `true`, and a `true` you did not earn lets the server null that column. An
  interface that loses its LLDP chassis ID drops out of link resolution permanently. If you do not
  read CDP, say `cdp: false`.

### 5. `execute()` returns `Completeness`, not `()`

`Complete`, or `Partial(CollectionShortfall { what, collected, expected })`, which becomes the
operator's warning. It is a return type rather than a field so that you have to name it at the point
you actually know. If you persist mid-flight — SNMP does, so that a hang in a late query cannot
leave a host with zero interfaces — use the `Checkpoint` you are handed; that is the only enrichment
that survives a timeout.

### 6. Classify your own errors

`AttemptOutcome` has one `From<&YourClientError>` implementation per client library. Write one.
Every dispatch branch must record an outcome; there is a debug assertion that fires if a credential
attempt leaves the ledger without a disposition.

### 7. Testing

Put I/O behind a trait and script fakes against it. `SnmpWalkTransport` in
`backend/src/daemon/discovery/integration/snmp/queries.rs` is the model, with around fifteen fake
agents in the same file. CI runs `cargo test --lib` only, so anything needing Docker or a database
will not run there.

SNMP additionally has a simulator: devices are typed Rust values in
`backend/src/daemon/discovery/integration/snmp/sim/devices/` with a required
`Purpose::Regression { issue, defect }`, and the workflow in `tools/snmp/SNMP-TEST-ENV.md` is *add a
struct, write the failing test, fix the code*. Never commit a captured device walk — rewrite
identifiers consistently, the same value to the same replacement, so the cross-table joins still
hold.

### 8. Conventions that will come up in review

- All user-visible strings go through paraglide i18n (`messages/en.json`, `prefix_camelCase`).
- No raw SQL: entity queries use `StorableFilter` and the generic storage layer.
- A service never touches another entity's storage layer, only its service.
- JSONB columns get a typed `SqlValue` variant, never a generic `serde_json::Value`.
- Backend enums reach the frontend through the generated schema. Never retype them in TypeScript.

## Testing

### Running Tests

Before submitting any PR, you must run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

This will:

- Stop any running dev containers
- Clean daemon config
- Run all backend and integration tests

### Testing Your Service Definition

#### 1. Verify Compilation

```bash
make dev-server
```

Check the server logs for any compilation errors.

#### 2. Test Discovery

If you have the actual service running on your network:

1. Start Scanopy with your changes
2. Navigate to the discovery page in the UI
3. Run a network scan
4. Verify your service is detected and correctly categorized
5. Check that the icon displays correctly

#### 3. Manual Testing

Even if you don't have the service running, you should verify:

- The service compiles without errors
- The pattern logic makes sense
- The category is appropriate
- The icon loads correctly

### Writing Tests (Optional but Appreciated)

If you're adding complex logic, consider adding unit tests:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_service_properties() {
        let service = YourService;
        assert_eq!(service.name(), "Your Service");
        assert_eq!(service.category(), ServiceCategory::Web);
    }
}
```

## Submitting Your Contribution

### Before You Submit

### Pre-commit Hooks

Scanopy uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. These hooks run automatically:
- **On commit**: Format and lint checks
- **On push**: Full test suite

The hooks are installed automatically when you run `make install-dev-mac`, `make install-dev-linux`, or `make install-dev-windows` — or standalone via `make install-hooks`. They're plain scripts in `.githooks/` (wired up via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`), so there's no extra tooling to install beyond what the project already needs.

To skip hooks when needed (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify  # Skip commit hooks
git push --no-verify    # Skip push hooks
```

**Pre-submission checklist:**

- [ ] Created a descriptive branch name
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] Ran `make format` to format all code
- [ ] Ran `make lint` with no errors
- [ ] Ran `make test` with all tests passing
- [ ] Tested your changes (if possible)
- [ ] Updated documentation (if needed)
- [ ] Committed with clear, descriptive messages

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **One change per PR**: Keep PRs focused
   - One service definition per PR
   - One bug fix per PR
   - Related changes can be grouped

2. **Clear title**: Use descriptive titles
   - `Add service definition for Grafana`
   - `Fix port scanning timeout issue`
   - `Update installation documentation`

3. **Good description**: Include context and details
   - What problem does this solve?
   - How did you test it?
   - Any breaking changes?
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)
