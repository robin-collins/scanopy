**Network documentation, without the drawing.**

Scanopy replaces manual network diagrams with a continuously maintained model of what's actually running. A single daemon scans on a schedule and produces four views from each scan: L2 (physical), L3 (logical), workloads, and applications. Unlike diagrams drawn in draw.io that go stale the week they're saved, or IaC state that misses drift and resources provisioned outside the pipeline, Scanopy reflects the current state of your infrastructure. Export as SVG, Mermaid, or Confluence; embed live maps; or feed the model into your existing source of truth.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic discovery**: Maps hosts and services by scanning the network. One scanner, no per-device agents.
- **230+ service definitions**: Auto-detects databases, web servers, containers, network infrastructure, and enterprise applications.
- **Four views from one scan**: L2 (physical), L3 (logical), workloads, and application dependencies.
- **Distributed scanning**: Deploy daemons across segments to map multi-site and multi-VLAN topologies.
- **Docker & SNMP integration**: Native discovery for containerized services and network hardware.
- **Scheduled rescans**: Documentation stays current as infrastructure changes.
- **Multi-user + RBAC**: Organization management, role-based access, and shareable live views for teammates or external stakeholders.

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Platform & DevOps teams**: Trace service dependencies without APM. Map containers, VMs, and hardware in one model.
- **Network engineers**: Multi-VLAN, multi-site topology diagrams derived from SNMP, LLDP, and ARP. No manual drawing.
- **IT operations**: Keep inventory, topology, and dependencies current across teams and sites.
- **MSPs**: Per-client documentation with shareable live views.
- **Home labs**: Document your infrastructure without opening draw.io.
