# UniFi Controller Test Environment

A self-hosted UniFi controller for developing and validating the UniFi integration
(`backend/src/daemon/discovery/integration/unifi/`).

## What this validates — and what it does not

**Read this before trusting a green run.**

| | Validated here | Needs real hardware |
|---|---|---|
| API-key auth (`X-API-KEY`) | ✅ | |
| Local-admin login + session cookie | ✅ | |
| UniFi OS vs legacy path detection | ✅ | |
| `{"meta":…,"data":[…]}` envelope | ✅ | |
| Site scoping, 401 vs 404 error shapes | ✅ | |
| Self-signed TLS handling | ✅ | |
| `port_table` → interfaces | | ✅ |
| `lldp_table` → LLDP neighbors | | ✅ |
| `mac_table` → bridge FDB | | ✅ |
| `uplink` / `downlink_table` → topology edges | | ✅ |

The right-hand column is confirmed, but not by this environment — a production deployment against
a real controller reported devices, ports and LLDP neighbors all resolving correctly. Nothing in
that column is reproducible here.

A controller with no adopted devices returns `"data": []` from `stat/device`. That confirms the
envelope and proves **nothing** about the device sub-table shapes — which are precisely the
fields Ubiquiti does not document and that we inferred from the unpoller Go structs. So a green
run here still leaves every right-hand row untested: adopt real hardware, or work from a captured
`stat/device`, before concluding anything about them.

### Measured behaviour (UniFi OS Server 5.1.21 / Network Application 10.4.57)

Facts established against a real controller, not inferred:

- Envelope is `{"meta":{"rc":"ok"},"data":[…]}`, exactly as modelled. `meta.rc` is `"ok"` on
  success.
- Both transports authenticate under the **UniFi OS layout** (`/proxy/network` prefix).
- **A site-scoped request with an unknown site name returns 401, not 404.** This is why the
  daemon validates the site against `api/self/sites` (which is *not* site-scoped) rather than
  reading status codes: a 401 from a site-scoped call cannot distinguish "wrong site" from
  "wrong credential", so a typo'd site name would otherwise be reported to the user as a
  rejected API key.
- `api/self/sites` works under both transports and returns each site's internal `name`, which
  is what lets the daemon name the valid sites back to the user.

## Which controller to install

API-key support is **UniFi OS only**:

| Port | Controller | API key | Local admin |
|---|---|---|---|
| 443 | UniFi OS console (UDM / Cloud Key / Cloud Gateway) | ✅ | ✅ |
| 11443 | **UniFi OS Server** (self-hosted) | ✅ | ✅ |
| 8443 | legacy self-hosted Network Application | ❌ **unsupported** | ✅ |

Install **UniFi OS Server** — it is the only self-hostable option that exercises the API-key
transport. To also exercise the legacy path, additionally run a Network Application container
(see "Legacy controller" below).

## Provisioning UniFi OS Server (Proxmox VM)

Requirements:

- Ubuntu 24.04+ or Debian 13+ (a Proxmox VM is fine; Hyper-V guests are explicitly unsupported)
- Podman ≥ 4.3.1 and slirp4netns ≥ 1.2 (**Docker is not a supported substitute**)
- Ports: 3478, 5005, 5514, 6789, 8080, 8444, 8880, 8881, 8882, 9543, 10003, **11443**

**Size the VM at 40 GB disk / 8 GB RAM / 2 vCPU.** Ubiquiti's headline "20 GB" figure is not
what the installer actually checks — its preflight wants **15 GB free on `/home` alone**, plus
1 GB on `/var/lib/uosserver` and 2 GB on `/tmp`, on top of the OS and the ~880 MB installer. A
20 GB disk fails that check.

RAM matters for a non-obvious reason: `/tmp` is a RAM-backed tmpfs sized from total memory, so a
2 GB VM gets a ~1 GB `/tmp` and fails the 2 GB `/tmp` check no matter how large the disk is.

Also **configure 2 GB of swap** — the installer warns if there is none:

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile && sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo 'vm.swappiness=15' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-swappiness.conf
```

If the disk needs growing after the fact, Ubuntu Server's LVM default takes two steps beyond
resizing it in Proxmox:

```bash
sudo growpart /dev/sda 3          # confirm the partition number with `lsblk`
sudo pvresize /dev/sda3
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
```

**Networking first.** If the VM was installed without a network, it will come up with only
`lo` and no default route, and every later step fails in a confusing way (`apt` reports packages
as "not available" when it really has no package lists at all). Verify before anything else:

```bash
ip -4 addr show && ip route      # expect an address on ens18 and a default route
ping -c1 archive.ubuntu.com
```

If `ens18` has no address, write `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` with `dhcp4: true` (or a static
`addresses:` / `routes:` / `nameservers:` block), `sudo netplan apply`, and re-check. If the link
shows `NO-CARRIER`, it is the hypervisor side — check the VM's NIC is on the right bridge/VLAN.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y podman slirp4netns curl
podman --version                 # must be >= 4.3.1; Docker is NOT a supported substitute
```

`podman` lives in `universe`; if it is missing, `sudo add-apt-repository universe` first.

**Then download the installer** — it is not bundled with anything and the URL is
version-specific, so it has to be copied from Ubiquiti's page each time:

1. Open <https://ui.com/download/software/unifi-os-server> in a browser.
2. Pick the Linux build matching the VM's architecture (`uname -m` → `x86_64` or `aarch64`).
3. Right-click the download button → **Copy Link Address** (a
   `https://fw-download.ubnt.com/data/unifi-os-server/…` URL). These expire, so fetch a fresh
   one rather than reusing an old link.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/uos && cd ~/uos
wget '<paste-the-URL>'           # quote it: the URL contains & and ?
ls -la                           # expect ~880 MB; a few KB means an HTML error page
file ./*-linux-*                 # must NOT report "HTML document"
chmod +x ./*-linux-*
sudo ./*-linux-*
```

The CDN names the file opaquely — something like
`f5e2-linux-x64-5.1.21-a400c9c6-8328-4634-b223-ebfcf742720a.21-x64`, not `unifi-os-server.sh`.
Match on `*-linux-*` rather than the product name, and check the size: the installer is several
hundred MB, so anything small is a redirect to a login or expiry page.

Then, in a browser at `https://<vm-ip>:11443`:

1. Complete first-run setup and create the console owner account.
2. **Create a local-only admin** for the integration: Settings → Admins & Users → Add Admin →
   *Restrict to Local Access*. A local-only account avoids the MFA prompt that blocks
   programmatic login on cloud-linked accounts.
3. **Create an API key**: Settings → Control Plane → Integrations → Create API Key. Copy it
   immediately; it is shown once.
4. Note the **internal site name** from the URL when viewing the site:
   `/manage/site/<name>` — this is what the credential's `site` field wants, *not* the site's
   display name. A fresh install is `default`.

### Legacy controller (optional, for the 8443 path)

```bash
podman run -d --name unifi-legacy --network host \
  -e TZ=UTC \
  -v unifi-legacy-config:/config \
  lscr.io/linuxserver/unifi-network-application:latest
```

Reach it at `https://<host>:8443`. Use it to confirm the legacy `/api/login` path and that an
API key really is rejected there — the integration surfaces a specific error message for that
case, and it should be checked rather than assumed.

## Running the checks

```bash
export UNIFI_HOST=192.168.7.240
export UNIFI_PORT=11443
export UNIFI_SITE=default
export UNIFI_API_KEY='...'
export UNIFI_USERNAME='scanopy'
export UNIFI_PASSWORD='...'

make unifi-status     # authenticate over both transports, detect the API layout
make unifi-capture    # write stat/sysinfo + stat/device to tools/unifi/captures/
```

`make unifi-status` reports each transport independently, so a controller that supports only
one still gives a useful result.

## Using captures as fixtures

`tools/unifi/captures/` is gitignored — captures contain MACs, IPs and device names.

To promote a capture into the test suite, copy it to `backend/src/tests/unifi/` and reference it
from the test module in `.../integration/unifi/mapping.rs`. **Update that module's provenance
comment**: the existing fixtures are explicitly labelled as hand-authored from unpoller structs,
and a captured payload must be labelled as captured. The distinction is the difference between
"our mapping rules are self-consistent" and "we parse real hardware correctly" — do not blur it.

## End-to-end against Scanopy

1. Create a **UniFi API Key** (or **UniFi Local Admin**) credential in the UI.
2. Target it at the controller's host, or at the daemon host if the controller runs there.
3. Run a discovery covering the controller's IP.
4. Expect: the controller host gains a *UniFi Controller* service; each adopted device becomes a
   host with a UniFi Switch / Access Point / Gateway service (matched from the controller's
   reported device type, not stamped); switch ports appear as interfaces; and LLDP neighbors
   resolve into L2 Physical topology edges.

With no adopted devices, only step 4's first clause is observable.
