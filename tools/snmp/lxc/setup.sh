# SNMP Test Environment — Proxmox VM setup
#
# The host harness only: interfaces, the three `pass` handlers, systemd units and
# verification. The devices themselves — every data file and every agent config —
# are generated from the typed definitions in
#   backend/src/daemon/discovery/integration/snmp/sim/
# and shipped alongside this script by `make snmp-deploy`. Nothing here describes
# a device, so nothing here can disagree with the structs about what one is.
#
# To add or change a device, edit the struct and run `make snmp-deploy`. See
# "Adding a device" in ../SNMP-TEST-ENV.md.
#
# EXPECT TRUNCATION WARNINGS. See "Known chaos" at section 3 — a scan of this
# environment normally reports several incomplete SNMP walks, and that is the
# simulator, not the product under test.

#
# KNOWN CHAOS — read this before chasing a truncation warning.
#
# snmpd forks this script, which then forks awk, once per SNMP request. With 22
# agents on one VM and ~17 column walks per host, a single scan is hundreds of
# concurrent forks, and under that load the agents answer some requests with the
# WRONG OID — one belonging to a request the daemon made earlier.
#
# Measured 2026-07-27, walking all 12 v2c devices from a single client:
#
#   serial      0 of 12 walks truncated
#   concurrent  4-5 of 12 truncated, a DIFFERENT set of devices each run
#
# Every truncation was `StaleResponse`: an in-subtree walk answered with an OID
# lower than the one requested, e.g. asking for lldpRemChassisId (.5) and getting
# lldpRemChassisIdSubtype (.4) back, or asking within ifXTable and being handed an
# LLDP OID that sorts below the entire subtree. A correct agent walking forward
# cannot produce that. It is not our client desyncing: the responses pass request-id
# and community validation, each session owns its own connected socket and its own
# request-id range, and the same walks are clean when run serially.
#
# So: a scan here normally emits several "was incomplete" warnings. They mean the
# simulator is thrashing. Judge a change by whether DATA was lost — interfaces
# pruned, neighbours wiped, links frozen — not by whether warnings appeared.
#
# This misbehaviour is worth keeping. A free adversarial agent surfaced three real
# defects in July 2026 (a foreign interface appearing on a switch, a chassis id
# overwritten with NULL leaving a link permanently unresolvable, and a truncated
# column reported as authoritative). If the noise ever needs quieting, `pass_persist`
# replaces the fork-per-request with one long-lived handler — but leave a device or
# two on `pass` deliberately, or the environment loses the property that found those.
