/**
 * Collapse presses must cost one layout each, and must not hold two ELK graphs at once.
 *
 * A customer's L2 view exhausted browser memory, and the resting footprint turned out not to be
 * the cause: the tab was measured swinging 881MB to 2050MB and back inside 90 seconds of
 * interaction, while diagnostics captured moments later read 267MB live. The cost is transient and
 * concentrated in the layout pipeline, which is why it survived several rounds of DOM and culling
 * work that all reduced the resting footprint.
 *
 * Two faults produced it, both asserted here:
 *
 *  1. **Runs were not cancelled.** ELK is ~96% of pipeline time, so a run takes 1.8-3.7s while
 *     presses arrive every ~2s. Every press landed mid-run, and the run in flight completed a full
 *     layout that the queued run discarded on arrival — a capture showed 8 runs for ~4 presses,
 *     all of them running ELK.
 *  2. **Both ELK passes were live at once.** `computeElkLayout` lays out twice, and the pass-1
 *     graph stayed reachable from the async function's heap-allocated scope while pass 2 built its
 *     own, doubling the peak.
 *
 * Absolute megabytes are not asserted: they depend on the machine, the dataset, and where GC
 * happens to fall — the same repro was seen peaking anywhere between 1.2GB and 2.6GB. What is
 * stable, and what actually regressed, is the *count* of layouts performed per press. Heap figures
 * are reported for context.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   1. `npm run dev` (Vite on :5173) plus a running backend.
 *   2. A seeded large L2 dataset — see `backend/scripts/seed-l2-perf.sql`.
 *   3. SESSION_ID from a logged-in browser session.
 *
 * Run:
 *   SESSION_ID=<session> npx playwright test tests/topology-layout-cost.ts --project=chromium
