/**
 * The frontend half of the slot contract.
 *
 * A code's sentence is a template with `{named}` slots, and three things have to agree on those
 * names: the Rust `description()`, the `slots()` the fixture publishes, and the parameters this
 * renderer passes to the paraglide message. The backend test
 * (`every_description_interpolates_exactly_the_slots_it_declares`) pins the first two together;
 * this pins the third to them. Without it, a renderer that forgets a slot compiles fine and shows
 * the operator a literal `{addresses}`.
