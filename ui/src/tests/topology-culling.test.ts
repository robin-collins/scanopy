/**
 * Culling has to actually reduce what gets mounted.
 *
 * A customer's L2 view held 17,236 nodes and mounted every one of them while the culling gate
 * reported itself on, which exhausted browser memory. The gate was fine; the nodes were not. Two
 * properties of a freshly built node set each defeat `getNodesInside` on their own:
 *
 *  - a node with no known height has `area === 0`, and the test is `overlappingArea >= area`, so
 *    `0 >= 0` passes for every node wherever the viewport is;
 *  - a node whose object carries no `measured` loses its handle bounds in `adoptUserNodes`, which
 *    sets `forceInitialRender` and short-circuits the viewport test entirely.
 *
 * Neither is visible from `shouldCull`, which is why the existing gate test passed throughout. So
 * these drive the *real* `adoptUserNodes` and `getNodesInside` from `@xyflow/system` over nodes
 * from the *real* `buildFlowNodes`, and assert on how many survive. That is the symptom the bug
 * produced, and the only thing that would have caught it.
