/**
 * The diagnostic has to be able to name the fault it was extended for.

 * A customer's report showed `culling: on` beside `mounted == store.nodes` and contained nothing

 * fields nothing was reading. `summariseCullability` is that reading, so these check it counts the
 * two conditions that make a node unconditionally visible.
