/**
 * The L2 Physical collapse levels 2 and 3, which rendered nothing.
 *
 * `PortOpStatus` subcontainers are `is_subcontainer` *and* `collapsed_by_default`, so in
 * L2 Physical they are closed at every level except 4 while their host containers stay open. That
 * makes levels 2 and 3 the only *mixed* states: some elements are laid out and have pass-1
 * positions, and some are inside a closed subcontainer and have none — yet both still emit ports,
 * because edge endpoints deliberately resolve through the collapsed ancestor.
 *
 * Level 1 (everything collapsed, no positions at all) and level 4 (nothing collapsed, every
 * position present) are uniform and always rendered, which is exactly the reported signature.
