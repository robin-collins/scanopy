		// pipeline run mounted the entire graph at least once no matter what the culling gate said.
		// At a few hundred hosts that full mount survives and culling engages afterwards; at
		// 17,000 nodes it exhausts memory first, and because measurement never completes the graph
		// never becomes cullable at all.
		//
		// `measured` is the right vehicle and the `height` prop is not: `NodeWrapper` applies a

		// leaves element cards free to size to their content while still giving culling a real

		// collapsed set, so it is true on every collapse press, and using it here dropped the hint
		// for nodes that had been placed from the layout graph and were not being measured at all.
		// An element's `height` is deliberately `undefined` on that path, so with no hint
		// `measuredHeight` was undefined, `cullable` was false, and the node was emitted with no
		// `measured` field — which per the note above means `forceInitialRender`. Every collapse
		// press therefore rebuilt the whole graph as unculled and mounted all of it, recovering only
