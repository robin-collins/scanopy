/**
 * Correct cached element sizes against what the mounted cards actually measure.
 *
 * Nodes are built carrying `measured` and `handles` so SvelteFlow can cull them before they have
 * ever rendered. The cost of that is `NodeWrapper` treating them as initialised and never
 * attaching a ResizeObserver — so nothing else notices if a card's real height drifts from the
 * cached value. A pipeline run re-measures after any topology change, and port expansion
 * re-measures explicitly, but a change with no pipeline run behind it (a font finally loading, a
 * theme switch) would otherwise leave a wrong height cached indefinitely, laying the graph out
 * around a card size that no longer exists.
 *
 * **Containers are excluded.** `viewSizeCache` holds a container's *natural* size, measured with
 * width and height unconstrained, while the container renders at the expanded size ELK computed
 * for it — two different numbers by design. Comparing them reports drift on every container on
 * every pass, and when the caller answers drift with a re-layout that is an endless loop: the
 * seeded reproduction turned over two corrective re-layouts every five seconds indefinitely, which
 * presents exactly as the hang this work set out to fix.
 *
 * `alreadyCorrected` bounds it further, to one correction per node per structure. Even a card that
 * genuinely cannot settle — one whose rendered height never matches what was measured for it —
 * costs one re-layout rather than a permanent cycle. The caller clears the set when the structure
 * changes.
 *
 * Bounded by the mounted set: a few hundred nodes with culling on, not the whole graph.
 *
 * @returns How many nodes drifted for the first time under this structure.
