/**
 * Checks that the element shape key actually predicts card height.
 *
 * Sampling the measure pass rests on one assumption: element nodes sharing a
 * shape key measure to the same height. If that is ever false, nodes are laid
 * out with a wrong height and the graph overlaps — with no error, because
 * nothing threw. This turns that silent failure into a reported one.
 *
 * It runs against a *full* measurement (every node mounted and measured), so it
 * validates the key without depending on sampling being correct. That makes it
 * usable both as a pre-flight check before sampling is trusted, and afterwards
 * as a regression guard when someone changes how cards render.
 *
 * Enabled by `window.__topoVerifyShapes`; off by default, since it needs the
 * expensive full measurement it exists to justify replacing.
