/**
 * Topology render-pipeline instrumentation.
 *
 * Exists so the Playwright perf harness (`ui/tests/topology-perf.ts`) can read
 * real stage timings and call counts out of the running app rather than
 * inferring them from wall-clock and DOM polling. Keeping it in the app — and
 * keeping it cheap — is what makes topology performance trackable over time
 * instead of a one-off measurement.
 *
 * Disabled unless the build is a dev build or `window.__topoPerf` is set, so
 * production pays nothing beyond one boolean test per call site.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const done = perf.stage('elk');
 *   ...
 *   done();
