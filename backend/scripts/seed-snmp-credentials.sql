-- Seed the SNMP credentials needed to scan the SNMP simulation environment.
--
-- The sim env (tools/snmp/SNMP-TEST-ENV.md) deliberately spreads its 16 devices across five
-- different credentials — three v2c communities, one v1-only, one v3 USM user — so that a scan
-- exercises credential selection, the v1/v2c/v3 negotiation paths, and the "try the next
-- credential" fallback rather than one community answering everything.
--
-- Each credential is assigned to every network in the database (Broadcast scope, via
-- network_credentials). Broadcast is the only option that works before a scan has run: PerHost
-- assignment needs hosts to exist, and the sim devices are exactly what the first scan discovers.
-- The daemon tries each assigned credential in turn against each IP.
--
-- Idempotent. Credential ids are derived from (organization_id, name), so re-running updates the
-- existing rows in place instead of accumulating duplicates, and any hand-edit to a seeded
-- credential is reset to the values here.

-- The credential set, kept in one place so both inserts below agree on names.
