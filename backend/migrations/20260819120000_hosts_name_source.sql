-- Per-field provenance for a host's display name (GH #680).
--
-- Until now the only answer to "did a person type this name, or did we derive it?" was
-- `name.parse::<IpAddr>().is_ok()` in the upsert merge. That recognises exactly one derived
-- shape, so a name derived from a detected service was indistinguishable from a hand-typed one
-- and froze forever, and a name a controller holds ("Core Switch") had no rung to occupy at all.
-- `name_source` records which rung of the ladder produced `name`, and the merge compares ranks
-- instead of guessing from the string. It is the discriminant of the `HostName` enum, so the
-- values here are that enum's variant names.
--
-- Additive and prod-safe: ADD COLUMN with a constant default is metadata-only (no rewrite).
-- `Manual` is the default on purpose — it is the top of the ladder, so any row the backfill below
-- does not reach keeps its name for good. Choosing wrong in that direction leaves a name stale;
-- choosing wrong the other way silently renames something a user named.
--
-- No contract step: nothing is renamed or dropped, and older servers ignore the column.

ALTER TABLE hosts
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS name_source TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Manual';

-- Backfill: apply the heuristics the code used to apply on every merge, exactly once. Anything
-- still recognisable as machine-derived is demoted so discovery may improve on it later; anything
-- else stays `Manual` and is never touched again.
--
-- Batched at 1000 rows with a COMMIT per batch (hence `-- no-transaction`): `hosts` carries SCD2
-- history and snapshot rows, so it is the largest table this could touch.
