//! Coded discovery scan warnings.
//!
//! A warning used to be an English sentence built on the daemon and rendered verbatim into the
//! scan record, so nothing downstream could count, group, localize or alert on one. What travels
//! now is a code plus the parameters that fill it; the sentence lives in
//! [`TypeMetadataProvider::description`] and is composed in the UI, where `Intl.ListFormat` can do
//! the joining in the reader's own language.
//!
//! Two rules shape the enum below.
//!
//! - **One code per claim.** Each variant is one arm of what used to be a renderer's `match` — one
//!   statement about one kind of failure. Collapsing "credential rejected", "TLS failed" and
//!   "unreachable" into one code would make the metric useless, because which of the three it was
//!   is the entire question an operator asks.
//! - **One warning per occurrence.** A warning names the single thing it is about and carries that
//!   thing's own details. Nothing is summed or flattened before the wire; the UI groups warnings
//!   sharing a code and joins their addresses for display. Aggregating first is what lost
//!   `collected` counts, per-address diagnostics, and the pairing between a credential and the
//!   address it failed at.
