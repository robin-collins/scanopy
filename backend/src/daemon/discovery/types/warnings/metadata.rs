//! The English behind each code, and the contract the UI fills it from.
//!
//! [`TypeMetadataProvider::description`] is a *template*: named slots the UI substitutes from the
//! warnings carrying that code. It reaches the browser as `meta_warning_codes_<Code>_description`
//! through the fixture and paraglide, which is what makes a scan warning translatable for the
//! first time.
//!
//! Slot names are declared once, by [`DiscoveryWarningCode::slots`], and published in the
//! fixture's `metadata` so the UI renderer is checked against the same list the template is. Two
//! things enforce the agreement rather than author discipline: `slots()` is an exhaustive match,
//! so a new code cannot compile without declaring its slots, and the test at the bottom of this
//! file walks every code and fails if a template's slots and its declared slots disagree.
//!
//! The joining is deliberately *not* done here. `{addresses}` arrives already joined by
//! `Intl.ListFormat` in the reader's locale, which is strictly better than the English "A, B, and
//! C" this code used to build.
