//! UniFi Network Application (controller) discovery integration.
//!
//! Reads `GET /stat/device` from a UniFi controller and turns the controller's inventory into
//! Scanopy hosts, interfaces, LLDP neighbors and bridge-FDB entries.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! UniFi switches (e.g. the USW-Pro-Max) do not expose LLDP-MIB over SNMP — a walk of
//! `1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.4.1` returns `No Such Object` — so SNMP-based L2 topology comes up empty
//! for them. The firmware collects LLDP internally and the controller API exposes it, so this
//! integration recovers the same neighbor data from a different source.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Unlike SNMP or Docker, one credential describes an endpoint that reports on *many* devices.
//! So `execute` enriches the scanned host only when the controller is itself a UniFi device
//! (a Dream Machine or Cloud Key), and creates the rest via `ops.create_host`. Everything it
//! produces flows into the same ingestion and neighbor-resolution path SNMP feeds; there is no
//! UniFi-specific topology code anywhere on the server.
//!
//! Layering: [`types`] holds the raw wire structs, [`client`] the HTTP transport and auth, and
//! [`mapping`] the wire → entity translation. A field-shape correction is a one-file change.
