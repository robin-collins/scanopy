//! A simulated device as an SNMP transport.
//!
//! This emulates *snmpd driving a `pass` handler*, not a sorted map. That distinction is the whole
//! reason a device test proves anything:
//!
//! - A GETBULK of `n` is `n` successive handler GETNEXTs, each starting from the previous answer,
//!   because that is how snmpd assembles a bulk response over a `pass` script that answers one
//!   varbind at a time. A model that returned a slice of a sorted table would make every page
//!   perfect and could never reproduce a walk that ends early.
//! - A request is routed to exactly one registration — the `pass` line whose subtree covers it —
//!   and that registration's answer is bounded to its own subtree. Falling off the end moves to
//!   the next registration, which is what makes a device serving nothing at a subtree report the
//!   next one up rather than inventing an answer.
//! - The three handlers (`Normal`, `Positional`, `Stuck`) are the three shell scripts in
//!   `tools/snmp/lxc/setup.sh`, and two of them are meant to misbehave.
