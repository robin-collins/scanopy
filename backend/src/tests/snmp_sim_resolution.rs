//! The simulated devices, resolved against a real database.
//!
//! These run against Postgres rather than the in-memory inventory on purpose. Every defect below
//! was a *SQL semantics* defect — a lookup with no `ORDER BY` and no `LIMIT` returning an arbitrary
//! row, or a tier that declined when it should have matched — and the fake inventory in
//! `server::lldp`'s tests re-implements those semantics in Rust, so it cannot fail the
//! way the database did.
//!
//! What makes them device tests rather than resolver tests is where the inventory comes from: the
//! far ends are seeded from what a real collection of the *simulated device* produced, so a fixture
//! that stops reporting the identifiers a neighbour is matched on breaks the test that depends on
//! it. Collection-side behaviour is covered without a database in each device's own module.
